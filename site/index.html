			<p >Piquote is an online application that parses webpages and produces an image with a relevant quote from the article imbedded in it. It works using Flask and a python text parser.

			<p >When the project first started, we were given the skin of the application with only the basic implementations of text parsing and sentence weighting

			<p >The focus of our project centered around higher quality sentence and image selection. I wrote a text parser that broke up the paragraphs into sentences and merged quotes in the text based on punctuation patterns. These Strings were then weighted based on many factors for use.
				</p>
			<p >	
			To the left is a sample of the repository of words selected by team members. The presence of these words was one of the factors used to weight the sentences.

			<p >Image selection was done with a DOM parser, and used the regular structure of news websites to filter out images for other articles or in advertisements by the tags of their parent containers.

			</p>
			
			<p>The end result allowed users to select one of a combination of quotes and pictures, and receive an image of their choosing.
